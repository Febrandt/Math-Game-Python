# Simple Math Game made in Python

I made a simple Math Game as a final project in my SENAI course.

## Brief Explanation
Here you can choose one of 3 players: 
Warrior, Archer, and Witch.  
With 3 difficulties: Easy, Medium, Hard.  

The battle is simple: You have to solve the math questions! Easy. But if you answer correctly too many times, you're gonna have problems!!!
