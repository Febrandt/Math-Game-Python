<h1>Simple Math Game made in Python</h1>

I made a simple Math Game as a final project in my SENAI course.

<h2>Brief Explanation</h2>
Here you can choose one off 3 players: 
Warrior, Archer and Witch.<br>
With 3 difficulties: Easy, Medium, Hard.<br>

The Battle is simple: You're have to resolve the math questions! Easy. But if you answer right too much, you're gonna have problems!!!


<h2>Code</h2>
<h3>Entity</h3>

<h3>Battle</h3>
Handles the math questions and answers.
<h3>Game</h3>
Here we have our game, used as a singleton for simpler usage.
<h3>Scenes</h3>
